# #assignig list of value to multiple variables
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# x, y, z = fruits
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# assingn multple sting to multiple variables and then concate
# x = "Python is Awesom"
# print(x)
# x = "Python"
# y = "is"
# z = "Awesom"
# print(x, y, z)

# x = "Python "
# y = "is "
# z = "Awesom "
# print(x + y + z)

#alse the plus can be used to add a variable to another variable
#also to perform mathematical operation
# x = 5
# y = 10
# print(x + y)

# also to concat the int,float with string
# if we use Plus here it will give erorr
#we can use it with different way changing the inti to string
# x = 10
# y = " Awais"
# print(x, y)
# print(str(x) + y)
