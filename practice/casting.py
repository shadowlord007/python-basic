#python casting
#converting a data type to another data type
# can cast int to string, float into string, string into
#int if the value inside is int or float, but cannot convert
#if the sting have character.

# x = 10
# y = 10.5
# z = "5"
# a = "5.5"

# print(float(x))
# print(int(y))
# print(int(z))
# print(float(z))

# if the sting value are in float then we can cast into float
# then if we want to cast into int we can do it
# but we cannot cast the float string value into int

# print(int(float(a)))
