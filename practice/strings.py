# can be define with single quote, double quote, triple quote
# a = "Assalam-o-alikum"
# b = 'walaikum-assalam'
# c = """How are you"""
# d = '''How are you'''

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# print(d)

# we can also use the triple quotes as a comment in python
# """Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s"""
# '''It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.'''

# also if we save these triple quotes in a variable then we can use it to print as it's.

# e = """Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s"""
# f = '''It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.'''

# print(e)
# print(f)
